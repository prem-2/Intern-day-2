On your second day, learning the Snipping Tool is a valuable skill, especially for webpage development. The Snipping Tool is a built-in screenshot utility in Windows that allows you to capture parts of your screen, which can be useful for:

Capturing designs: If you're working on a webpage layout or design, you can use the Snipping Tool to capture a specific area of your page or a particular section of your code for reference or sharing with teammates.

Annotating images: After capturing a screenshot, you can annotate the image, which is helpful for noting things that need improvement or highlighting specific parts of the page you're working on.

Collaboration and feedback: Snipped images are great for collaborating with others, whether it’s a screenshot of a page for review, or you need feedback on a section of your web development project.

Using the Snipping Tool to gather visuals or document issues can save time, help with debugging, and improve communication with team members or clie

On Day 2 of your internship, you focused on learning HTML basics and web page creation. Here's a summary of what you likely learned and worked on:

Understanding HTML Structure:

You learned the basic structure of an HTML document, including the essential tags:
<html>: Defines the start and end of the HTML document.
<head>: Contains metadata like the title of the page (<title>) and links to stylesheets or scripts.
<body>: Contains all the visible content on the page, like text, images, and links.
Creating Content:

You added different types of content to your page:
Headings: <h1>, <h2>, etc., for titles and subheadings.
Paragraphs: <p> to display text.
Lists: <ul> for unordered lists (bullets), <ol> for ordered lists (numbered), and <li> for each list item.
Adding Links and Images:

You worked with hyperlinks using the <a> tag, linking to external websites or other pages.
You added images with the <img> tag, specifying the src (source) and alt (alternative text) attributes.
Web Page Layout:

You started thinking about how to organize your content into sections using <div> or <section>, which is helpful for styling and layout later on.
Attributes:

You got familiar with how HTML attributes work, such as href for links, src for images, and alt for accessibility descriptions.
Basic Styling (Optional):

If you touched on CSS, you may have added some simple inline styles to modify the appearance of text, colors, and alignment, starting to get a feel for how styling works alongside HTML.
By the end of Day 2, you likely created a simple, functional webpage with text, links, and images, putting your understanding of HTML into practice.
